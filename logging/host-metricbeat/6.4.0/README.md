## Summary

> Getting host stats into elasticsearch 

This container will need be mounted to host network.

If you are using rancherOS, or a restricted OS use the following.

`/proc/:/hostfs/proc/:ro`
`/sys/fs/cgroup/:/hostfs/sys/fs/cgroup/:ro`
`/etc/hostname:/hostfs/etc/hostname:ro`

If your system allows it, you can simplify the above with the following (not fully tested).

`/:/hostfs/:ro`

Finally of course, ensured that `elasticsearch` is configured.

## Configuration

``` 
# Interval of capturing metrics
ENV METRIC_PERIOD 1s

# Elasticsearch host to push into
ENV ES_HOST    elasticsearch

# Elasticsearch port to push into
ENV ES_PORT    9200

# Elasticsearch protocall to use
ENV ES_PROT    "http"

# Elasticsearch username to use
ENV ES_USER    elasticsearch

# Elasticsearch password to use
ENV ES_PASS    PleaseChangeThisToActualPassword

# Elasticsearch index to use 
ENV ES_INDEX  "metricbeat-%{+yyyy.MM.dd}"
```

## Data collected

Currently this metricbeat is configured to collect the following inside metricbeat.yml
```
metricsets:
  # CPU stats
  - cpu
  # Per CPU core stats
  - core
  # System Load stats
